## Project Description

<< I will be creating a game called "Mole Run." In this game, there will be a moving mole that attempts to avboid underground drills. This will be a sideways 2D game, where the screen/map will constantly move from left to right with the player. There will be a menu screen, a record of highscores by the player, as well as a message and image that gets displayed when the player gets hit by a drill. As the player goes through the map, he will be able to collect tokens.>>
